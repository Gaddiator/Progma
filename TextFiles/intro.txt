Awaken my child, you have slumbered for far too long. There is a darkness the likes of which have never been seen before, slowly spreading across this land.
A darkness that will be destroyed. I remember a time of hero's. Intelligent magician's, powerful warrior's and cunning rogue's. Peace and prosperity. Balance and harmony.

Alas that time is no more, evils plague the land and I have not the power to stop them. There is no fight, there are no hero's, there will be no future.
However, there is hope. There has been and will always be hope. A time nigh approaches where once again there shall be a fight, there will be hero's, and we will have a future.

You my child are that hope.
