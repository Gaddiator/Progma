I need to create a GUI to let the user alter their starting attribute points at character creation. This will allow the player a bit more freedom and helps for role-playing.

    //Magician
    - If the character is a magician they will have mostly high magical stats, however they will have a few points to push toward other skills such as combat or stealth if they so which.

    //Warrior
    - If the character is a warrior they will have mostly high combat stats, however they will have a few points to push toward skills in stealth and combat if they so which.
      However the warrior cannot use magic (at least not initially) therefore they cannot push points toward magic.

    //Rouge
    - If the character is a rouge they will have mostly high stealth stats, however they will have a few points to push toward skills in combat and stealth if they so which.
      However the rouge also cannot use magic (at least not initially) therefore they cannot push points toward magic.


    The main reason for this is to allow players to choose what skills they want to major in and therefore determine how they will play the game.
    I feel as though it adds a critical piece of functionality to the game, and also makes the game more of a personal experience allowing players to role play successfully.

    More thought and time will be assigned to this in the future. There will be balancing and certain conditions to review.
    Although for now the main functional requirements of the game need the majority of attention and focus of the sole developer that is me.
