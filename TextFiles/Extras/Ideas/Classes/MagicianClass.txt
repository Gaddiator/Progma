The idea of making the magician that you play as, a young apprentice Mage who was sent to the Temple that you wake up in (if you choose the Magician as a class), to study magic after you were found to have great magical talent residing in you.
They wake up not giving the player much of an insight as to who they are or where they are or what there doing there or what happened to the Temple. The player will have no insight what so ever as to why there is death and destruction surrounding them.

It will become apparent in the opening scenes that you were indeed a young magician practicing your craft in the northern steeps of Progma.
After studying for a small amount of of time just as your coming into your true power and finally starting to hone your talent, the Temple you were studying at was attacked by a collection of Wights and Banes.

All your fellow apprentices and masters was brutally murdered, and the only reason your alive is because some fallen masonry obscured your body from sight.

This is where you will start learning about how to play as the magician and how it differences from the other classes.
