This is a secondary province and will be considered a DLC. Work will be started on this once development of Progma is complete and it will the the next addition to the series.
Asthcardia is a relatively peace province however, it is permeated to its core with powerful magical residue from times past. This means that there are many unique creatures and locations with new dangers.
It is a very forested land and mostly everywhere that isn't under the shadowy blanket of branches is due to human or magical interference.
While it is teeming with wildlife and nature there are still many areas to explore. Lakes, caves, orchards, meadows and much more.

One interesting thing to note is that forgotten and scattered throughout the land are portals, which if used will transport the player to another location.
Some portals will be useful, others not so much. Some will transport you to new and exiting areas, while some might thrust you into the most dangerous and volatile environments.
One thing is for certain, you'd better think twice before entering one of these.

The addition of this will implement new spells, quests, character, items and much more.
