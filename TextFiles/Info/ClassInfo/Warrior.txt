The Warrior focuses on all things combat, using heavy armour and multiple weapons to destroy opposition.
They have a high strength and endurance which comes in handy when intimidating people and overcoming physical exertions.
While they wreak havoc in close quarter combat they are venerable to long range spells or missiles.
Overall they are a very versatile class and rewarding to play, when used correctly.
