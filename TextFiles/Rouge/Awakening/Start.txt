The first thing you see when you awaken is three pair's of steel boots all pointing toward you. Raising your head slowly you see three faces looking down at you. Each man is wearing a full set of steel armour.
From their toes up you see each sporting a pair of boots, sturdy looking greaves, a fine chest plate, some chainmail gloves along with some leather vambraces and a flowing red cloak. Topping it all off, upon their heads sits some finely engraved helms.
Two of them have gleaming longsword's strapped at their waist, while the last one has a huge war-axe slung over his back. Each has the city guard crest embroidered onto their cloak signifying their position therein.

In the few seconds it took you to process all this you realized that your plan has failed and your in some serious trouble. The one in the middle grunts and says, "Take this thieving scum to the cells, throw away the keys!".
The two guards hoist you up, one on each side and haul you away.  You feel groggy and your head pounds furiously. You must have been smacked unconscious when you were caught.
It all seem hazy in your mind now, the break in, the fight, the running through the streets. You had almost escaped too, but alas for it was not to be. Wiping these thoughts from your mind you try to focus on the more imminent situation.

You know 'the cells' of thristvor hold are a dark, cold and disgusting place. Many prisoners have rotted away in them never to be seen again, and they had probably committed crimes far less serious than you have.
You need to get away and soon, but you still feel weak and feeble. Stone buildings pass you by as the guards haul you through the city closer to the hold and awaiting cells. If your going to do something you need to act quick!
