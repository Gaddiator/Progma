1The second you turn your back you intuitively know you've made a fatal mistake.
After about only a step or two the brute lands on your back knocking the breath out of you and knocks you to the floor.
You don't get any chance to retaliate after that. The werewolf rips into your back smashing your spine and pulling out your guts.
You can barely even scream but you do manage a chocked gurgle, blood spewing from your mouth.
The last thing you feel before the end is its head poking around inside of you eating whatever organs it can get to...

You are dead!
