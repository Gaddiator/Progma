You slowly draw your sword a subtle shiiiiiing noise reverberates around the clearing as the metal scrapes against the scabbard.
All the while your eyes never leaving the beast and its eyes never leaving you.
It takes a step forward and you instinctively take a step back stumbling on the bodies around you.
The minor slip was all the werewolf was waiting for and it pounces fast and aggressive toward you.

You must fight!
