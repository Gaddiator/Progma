Sweeping aside your fear you charge straight at the beast which seems to take it by surprise, after all what type of lunatic charges a hefty seven and a half foot werewolf.
It raises it arms defensively and yowls a high pitch keen, and its fear becomes anger and it starts up with a low growl once more, lowering its arms into a attacking position.
Just as your thinking this you see the werewolf tense its tree trunk legs and slide its claws forward in preparation to pounce and gut you.
If you are to survive you'll need to think fast.
