You open your mouth to shout but only get out a syllable before it leaps straight at you and slashes half of your face off with one of its claws.
Your blood squirts out all over the beast, making it growl in response.
It then takes a step forward and rents you in two, spooling out your guts and other internals.
The pain is excruciating and you feebly try to push some of your innards back inside.
Although the werewolf sticks it head right up in your torso gulping down everything, crunching your bones and tearing your limbs off.
You die screaming horribly geysers of blood flying everywhere.

You are dead!
