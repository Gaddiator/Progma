Crouching down you launch yourself backwards through the door back into the magistrum, the blade flashing over your head.
You land and roll using your agility to propel yourself to your feet and away from the bane.

There is about twenty feet between you and the bane. It stands through the door looking out at you a murderous grimace plastered to its demonic face.
The door to the library where you first awoke lies to your left, the only other escape is through the smashed window to your rear.

You need a plan and you need it fast.
What do you do?

Turn and leap through the window. - (Press 1)
Turn and run through the door. - (Press 2)
Send a bolt of energy at the bane. - (Press 3)
