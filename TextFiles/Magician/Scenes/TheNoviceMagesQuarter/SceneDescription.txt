Taking a few steps into the gloomy room you freeze and your breath catches in your throat. There at the head of the room before the alter and turning toward the now open doorway you've just created stands a bane.
Its demonic blood covered face, and piercing crimson eyes seem to look right down into your soal. Your blood starts to pound in your veins and you are sure that it can hear you hearts sporadic sputtering.

The monster for that is the only word to describe it, a utterly terrifying monster, stands at least six and a half feet tall.
You see that it wears no attire on its upper body clearly showing its muscular chest arms and midriff which is covered in rough knotty scars that twist and twirl over its hard grey skin.
Its lower body is covered by a hard shiny armour that looks to be a mix of boiled leather and fur. You see three skulls dangling from its waist tied on with each victims greasy long hair.
Rotting flesh still covers some of them and you fancy that you see a maggot or two wiggling around inside.

Taking a step down from the alter and moving slowly, confidently toward you the Bane reaches over its shoulder pulling a wicked looking serrated sword from its back.
It then smiles showing rows of pointed teeth and howls demonically down the corridor at you. Holding both your hands over your ears against the force of the shout you instinctively take a step back.
Even though your a powerful Magician, you know that you are no master, only a mere apprentice and you also know that even the wisest and most powerful of your order would be seriously wary of this abomination.
This is not a good situation to be in.
