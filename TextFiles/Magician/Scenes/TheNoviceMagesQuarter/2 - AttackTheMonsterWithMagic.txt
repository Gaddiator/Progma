A few seconds after processing the situation, you come to the stark reality that your going to die. The feeling of that makes your entire being shake with uncontrollable fear and rage.
Looking at the monster intent on taking your life, a malicious rage explodes from withing you and your wrath bubbles and churns inside of you, a volcano of force and energy just waiting to be released.

Looking back to the bane you start to move your hands in a complex pattern, instincts guiding you.
Opposite you, you see the demon raising its hands in a defence, preparing itself for the inevitable magical attack from you.

With your hands and use of your mind you grab three large pieces of rubble and launch them straight at the Bane. Shrieking it deflect one with a strike of its sword sending dust particles flying through the air.
The next he explodes with a magical burst the rock fragmenting into a million parts. The last piece however connects with a satisfying thunk and sends the monster smashing into one of the pillars.

A few seconds later it rises, blood oozing out of the multiple gashes on its face and head. It looks at you and smiles demonically before its tongue slithers up its face to taste the blood.
Then it charges, swinging for your head with its sword. If you don't think quick its going to decapitate you.
