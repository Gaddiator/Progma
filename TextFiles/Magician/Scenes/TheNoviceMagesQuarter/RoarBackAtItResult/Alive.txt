Even though your arm is sizzling away you force yourself to stand, and send another wave of force toward the bane launching it to the head of the room.
If you don't run as fast as you can away from the abomination trying to kill you a lot more of you is going to be sizzling away.

You run straight into the main library through the magistrum, bits of your arm dripping down your side.
You can hear the bane pursuing you, the sounds of its roars and smashing objects reverberates down the hall!

Stumbling into the area you woke up in you try to think, but the pain and terror are taking a toll.
If you don't escape soon then your not going to escape at all.
