Turning you make your way toward the magistrum door which you heft open, its heavy iron hinges creaking loudly in protest. As the gap widens between the door you manage to make out a few vague shapes moving around inside.
On cue the shapes stop moving and appear to turn toward you. Unsettled you back out starting to close the door again. You don't make it. Something grabs you from behind pulling you away from the door with immense strength.
Wiggling you manage to get a look at a fleshy half rotted face of a wight! It must have been in the room all along and the creaking of the door alerted it to your presence. Worse still you spot another one moving over from a far corner.

"Shit" is all you think knowing that your in a dangerous situation.
You smack an elbow into the things face which causes a cracking noise and sends a liquid shooting across your arm. Must have broken it nose you think.
You quickly free yourself from its grip, just in time to see three more wights coming in from magistrum. The situation is quickly spiraling out of control.

All five wights stand looking at you until the one with the broken nose hisses and launches itself at you.

You must fight!
