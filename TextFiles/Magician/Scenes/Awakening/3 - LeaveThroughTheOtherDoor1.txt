Turning you make your way toward the magistrum door which you heft open, its heavy iron hinges creaking loudly in protest. As the gap widens between the door you manage to make out a few vague shapes moving around inside.
Suddenly the shapes stop moving and appear to turn toward you. Unsettled you back out while trying to close the door again. You don't make it. Something grabs you from behind pulling you away from the door with immense strength.
Wiggling you manage to turn and get a look at a fleshy half rotted face of a wight! It must have been in the room all along and the creaking of the door alerted it to your presence. Worse still you spot another one over in a corner.

You curse loudly as you feel the fear setting in, using that curse to turn all of your fear into a raging, righteous anger. You know very well that if you don't do something very soon your going to be, how would a white put it, oh yeah, 'fresh meat'!
You smack an elbow into the things face which causes a shriek in pain accompanied by a sharper, louder, cracking noise. You feel some gooey liquid shoot across your arm. 'Fucking disgusting' you think. However it lets go of you, giving you space to move.
You quickly roll away, placing your back to the same masonry which you woke up under. You see three more wights bursting in from magistrum bringing the total number to five. Then they slowly turn and glare you with the murderous gleam of the dammed in their eyes.
They slowly press forward pushing you further into the corner, surrounding you. You raise your hands, preparing yourself for either slaughter or a brutal death. Unwillingly your features slowly transition from a deep set grimace of fear to a fierce animalistic snarl.

You must fight!
