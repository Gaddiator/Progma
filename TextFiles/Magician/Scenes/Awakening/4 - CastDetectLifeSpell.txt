You decide to cast a life detection spell just in case anyone is still breathing. You might be able to help someone at the least. Muttering the incantation you feel magical energy ebbing from your core transforming your surrounding.
The room shimmers and turns dark for a second and then one faint smudge of light appears, marking the presence of someone alive. Standing you move toward the corner where you detected the presence. 
Although you cant see anything you can discern a soft moaning. Almost a cry it seems. Louder slurps and cracks accompany the moaning. Cautiously you edge withing range of sight and see a young mage being eaten alive by two wights.
Your detect life spell wouldn't have picked up these two dead flesh bags and there sudden appearance startles you. Unsure at what to do you look to the young mans face trying to see how bad his wounds are.

Just at that moment the young mage seemed to finally slip into the void with one final long breath coming out of him. Finally the wights seem to notice you and quick as lightning they jump up and try to scratch and slice at you.
Due to the darkness you cant see much and one of them manages to slice you a hearty wound - ( - 4 health). Reacting by instinct you send a buffet of air toward the two of them and launch them across the room where they land in a heap.
Snarling the undead rotted flesh eaters rise and hiss at you. You know from experience these monsters are much more than they appear. With the enhanced strength and speed of any human they make formidable foes. 
A chunk of meat slips from between ones mouth and they launch themselves at you once more. Unless you want to end up like the young mage you'll need to think fast.
