Taking one last look around the dark library you decide your best choice is to leave through the main door while you can and search for clues as to what transpired while you were out.
Turning you head toward the main door when suddenly two wights that had been hidden away in the corner feasting on one of your companion jump out and ambush you, leaping at your throat.
