The first thing you see when you open your eyes up is a dead novice mage. His frail limbs broken and hanging limp. Most are sticking out at all sorts of odd angles.
The result of a fierce magical attack no doubt. Looking around in disbelief you witness much more atrocities, each scene impossibly far more visceral than the last.

Bodies lay scattered around the ruined library. Many seem like they have been torn apart and eaten, while others have been crushed, pulverised, charred and sliced.
There is a overwhelming smell of blood in the air, the likes of which you have never before experienced. A thick, pungent, slightly metallic, sickly sweet stench.
You even see some young magicians who are frozen completely solid with ice magic along with some others who are burnt similarly to a well roasted juicy lamb chop.

Fallen masonry covers most of your body obscuring you from sight. You're wedged in tight but, after a few seconds of wiggling you manage to create a little space.
You pause for a moment trying and collect some of your hazy thoughts. You must have been put to sleep by a falling stone you realize. Your head is still pounding.
The only reason the banes and wights hadn't killed you is because you were lucky enough to be hidden by the fallen debris. Sadly, not many others can say as much.

There is a powerful sense of evil in the air and you feel a deep rooted terror smothering you. You try to calm down, forget your fear and begin to free yourself.
After a couple of tense seconds wiggling back and forth you manage to ease your shoulder out, cutting it in the process but, getting it free along with your arm.
After that its only a matter of time before you manage to squeeze out your other arm, pop your legs out from under the largest block of fallen debris and get up.
That's the way to survive you think, just keep moving one foot after the other. You need to be very careful as you are still in an extremely dangerous situation.

Slowly you roll over into a crouch alert for danger, each and every one of your senses in overdrive. You feel ready to pounce at even the slightest provocation.
After what seems like a lifetime you realise that you are in no imminent danger. You can hear your heart pounding loudly in your ears as you scan surroundings.
