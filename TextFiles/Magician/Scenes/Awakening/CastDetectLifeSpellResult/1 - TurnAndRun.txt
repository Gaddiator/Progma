You turn in preparation to bolt but only make it a single step before both of the abominations pounce on you, knock you to the floor and start to tear and bite into you.
Struggling against their strength you fail to rise and after another futile moment on of them manages to slice your back wide open and insert its hand firmly inside of you.
The pain is excruciating as both of them rip into you crunching bones and spooling out your organs eating whatever they can get to. You try to push some of your internals back inside but cant manage it.
After one last futile failure to free yourself you realize you made a fatal mistake trying to run from these things. Time passes slowly as the things eat you alive mercilessly ripping out every sticky body parts they can find.
After what feels like hours the pain drives you insane and you finally succumb to the awaiting darkness.

You are dead!
