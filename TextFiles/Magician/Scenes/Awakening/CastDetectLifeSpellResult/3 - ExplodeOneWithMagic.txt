You shoot a ball of black energy into ones chest which cause's its skin to move like rippling water. A second later it explodes sending pieces of flesh and organs raining down upon you.
The remaining wight slashes your arm open, knocking you off balance you slip on the gore covered floor - ( -4 health). Suddenly the wight is on you chest and if you don't act fast its going to rip your face off.
Acting purely by instinct you blast the monsters head with an air burst blasting it of its shoulders and into the far corner of the room.
A geyser of blood erupts from the stump before the headless body collapses still twitching to the floor, blood pooling across the stone masonry.
