Summoning forth your magical energy you will a light into existence which immediately forms and bathes the area in a light blue hue, which forces the shadows to submit and recede to its ultimate power.
Once your eyes adjust you make out two blurry shapes, which rapidly sharpen to reveal two wights in the corner eating something.

The appearance of the light immediately draws their attention and they turn toward you hissing and spitting. A long strip of what appears to be flesh drops from one of their mouths with a wet smack.
Both of them rise and start lumbering toward you their arms extended outward in an aggressive manner. You almost laugh at the hideous sight but you hold your composer unbidden memories coming to mind.

What you know of wights is that they are unintelligent, flesh eating, humanoids who are usually resurrected by banes to serve as their grunts.
You also know that the ugly rotted bastards are much stronger and agile than they look.

As well as reading about their strengths you also recall reading about their weaknesses too, such as their aversion to bright light and fire if you remember correctly.
With that knowledge in mind and the lumbering flesh bags coming closer toward you by the second you'll need to think quick before they overwhelm you.
