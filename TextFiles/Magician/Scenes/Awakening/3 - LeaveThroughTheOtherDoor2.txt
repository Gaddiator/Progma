Turning you make your way toward the magistrum door which you heft open, its heavy iron hinges creaking loudly in protest. As the gap widens between the door you manage to make out a few vague shapes moving around inside.
On cue the shapes stop moving and appear to turn toward you. Unsettled you back out starting to close the door again. Your not fast enough though, one launches itself through the gap tackling you to the ground.
You quickly free yourself from its grip, just in time to see the rotten face of a wight and two more wights coming in from magistrum.

The situation is quickly spiraling out of control, slowly still facing the door and wights you back up creating space to move.

Its lucky you found and killed the others otherwise this situation would have been seriously dire, you might not have made it out if you had to take on the two from behind as well as however many are through the door.
Even though you were originally surprised, or caught unaware with some space between you and them you feel confident you can take the pus bags. Summoning two fireballs into your hands you charge.
All three wights stand looking at you until the one with the broken nose hisses in retaliation and launches itself at you.

You must fight!
