Turning you make your way toward the magistrum door which you heft open, its heavy iron hinges creaking loudly in protest. As the gap widens between the door you manage to make out a few vague shapes shuffling around inside.
Suddenly the shapes stop moving and appear to turn toward you. Unsettled you back out while trying to close the door again. You don't make it. One launches itself through the gap tackling you to the ground and away from the door.

Your lucky to have found and killed the two other wights earlier, otherwise this situation would have been much more dire. You might not have made it out if you had to take on the two from behind as well as however many more are through the door.
That's when you see two more wights bursting in through the door as you beat the white on top of you with your elbow. You manage to slip free just in time and quickly jump and roll away creating a little room to maneuver. They shriek and rush you.
Even though you were originally taken by surprise, or caught unaware, now with some space between you and them you feel confident you can take the flesh bags. With some effort you summoning two fireballs into your hands and roar a fierce battle cry.

You must fight!
