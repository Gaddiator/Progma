What you know of these 'wights' is that they are highly unintelligent, dead flesh eating, humanoids who have been resurrected by a bane to serve as their grunts.
You also know that the ugly rotted bastards are much faster, stronger and agile than they look. Many a man has underestimated them just to pay the ultimate price.

As well as reading about their many strengths you also recall reading about their weaknesses and if you remember correctly they dislike bright light and fire.
With that knowledge in mind and the lumbering flesh bags coming closer to you by the second you'll need to think quick before they grab you and overwhelm you.
