Edging into the magistrum through the door you've just killed the wights at you see another old reinforced iron door to the left and a similarly designed hatch on the ground to your right.

The rest of the room is fairly spacious. Smashed pillars and concrete pieces lay scattered about and in center of the room lies a fountain, the sound of the water trickling seems especially loud to your ears.
Apart from that, all you see is some broken barrels in one corner, a collection of burnt tomes and scattered books, along with some snow creeping in through the broken window frames.
Glass crunches under your feet as you surreptitiously delve deeper into the room.

You know the hatch to your right leads to the cellar, its where the food and provisions are stored. The door on left leads to the novice mages quarters.
All the wights lay dead behind you.
