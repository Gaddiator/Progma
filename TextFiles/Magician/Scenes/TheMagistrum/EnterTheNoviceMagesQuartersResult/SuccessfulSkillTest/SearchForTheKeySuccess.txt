You doggedly search high and low for a key, minutes elapsing into hours. Finally after almost two hours of searching through broken masonry, charred books, and other clutter you decide that it is hopeless turn your attention back to the door.
Walking back toward it intent on figuring out another solution your foot strikes something that was hidden amongst some stone pieces and broken wood. Excitement flares in your chest.
You are a determined person and you willpower is unquestionable. The fact that you searched for so long only highlights this aspect of your character. However your luck hasn't always held out.
Very slowly, and with caution you bend down to see a small hand size chest. Opening it, for it isn't locked you find a old iron wrought key, 3 gold coins and 2 silver coins.

Dubious of your own luck you pocket the coins and take the key in your hand, walking steadily toward the door. When you reach it you slide the key in without resistance and turn expecting nothing to happen.
However the key does turn and you feel the inner mechanics of the lock yielding to its rightful other. You hear the bolt unlock with a satisfying click and place your fingers on the handle.

Your willpower attribute increased by 3 points!
Your luck attribute increased by 2 points!


Just before you open the door you think to the destruction and monsters you have seen and the atrocities witnessed. Struggling with the prospect of whether its wise or not to push down the handle one question reverberates around your mind.
