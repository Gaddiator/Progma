While you do have a lockpick in your possession, you know its more of a souvenir than anything. You've never practiced your skill and are pretty certain that you will be unable to pick the lock.
Regardless of you lack of experience you push the pick into the lock. A few minutes later of fumbling it around inside you feel a strain and thinking you've somehow luckily popped the pins into place you turn the pick.

However the lock does not open like you expected, instead the pick snaps, one end stuck inside of the lock and the other end rests in your palm.
One things for sure, nobody is opening this door without forcing it. The broken piece is wedged firmly in the lock and doesn't budge when you try to pull it out.
The chances of removing it to fit another pick inside are null, you doubt you could open the door now even if you found the key!

Well its not like you really expected it to work anyway and tossing away the useless piece you begin once again to revise your options...
