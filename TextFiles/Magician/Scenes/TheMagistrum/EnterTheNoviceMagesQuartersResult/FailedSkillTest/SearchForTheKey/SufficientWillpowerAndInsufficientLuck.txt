You search and search and search, not stopping when many others might have. Your teachers always praised you on your dogged determination and willpower. If you wanted something you never stopped until you got it.
Alas after over an hour searching You realize that even if you searched in here every night and day for the next week you might not find a key. This is as much based on luck as it is on willpower you think.
And you most surly aren't the luckiest. However your proud that you didn't give up the search straight away when many others would have.

You have gained 5 points toward you willpower stat.

Returning to you thoughts you once again begin to evaluate your options in hopes of finding a suitable solution...
