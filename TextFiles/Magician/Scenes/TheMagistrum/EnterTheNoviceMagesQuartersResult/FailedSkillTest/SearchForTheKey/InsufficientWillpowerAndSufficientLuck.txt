After thirty seconds of searching through piles of burnt books, broken masonry and other clutter your willpower breaks and you give up. The chances of finding anything in this mess are virtually non existent.
Either you would have to search for hours or require great luck to find the key. You know that your not going to search for hours pointlessly because your not one for wasting time. However your luck has always surprised you, but unfortunately not today.
Turning you start to walk back to the door in frustration however, before you leave your foot strikes something and you hear a sharp metallic sound. Looking down you see a small hole almost hidden by the large pieces of fallen masonry.

There's no way you think bending down to inspect the area. Feeling around in side you feel something and when you withdraw your hand out comes a leather pouch. Opening it you glimpse some coins. It might not be the key but welcome none the less.
You quickly count the coins. You found 1 gold coin and 3 silver coins. Smiling you transfer the coins to your own pouch. Talk about luck you think.

Anyway these coins aren't going to open the door you think and you once again start to evaluate your options...
