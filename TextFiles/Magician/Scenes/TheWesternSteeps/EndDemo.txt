Turning back toward the main door you edge outside into the western steeps of Progma. Snow covers everything around you from the rock covered ground and temple walls to the numerous pine trees swaying in the wind.
Straight ahead is the snowy track from the mages Temple to the nearest town, Daruth. You know you should follow the road to the settlement as to let the people know what has happened to all the mages and to the temple.
You wont do it though because right now you have only one thought on your mind, revenge!

Breathing in the cold air you turn away from the road, rage and disgust running through you. Those people in their had been your friends, you family they didn't deserve to die like that.
You focus your thoughts and come to a quick conclusion, you turn away from the road, intent on killing everyone responsible for the destruction of everything you've ever known.
"Lets go kill some undead bastards" you whisper to yourself and take your first first step into the wilderness, leaving the man you had once been behind.
