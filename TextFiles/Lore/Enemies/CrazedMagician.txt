Many a magician has become totally insane, wandering around hurling bolts of lightning and fire at anything that moves.
Usually this is caused by one not being careful and delving too deep into areas of magic that alter the mind such as dark magic and death magic.

None other than the magician themselves know exactly how it happens. Maybe they learn a dark spell and the knowledge drives them crazy.
Or perhaps they lose control of their powers and do something terrible. Either way once the madness sets it doesn't go away.

Some of these magicians are not a harm to anyone but others are deadly and sinister their mind altered and twisted, making them do terrible things.
The aggressive types are the one to be wary off. The strength of most magician who have gone mad is quiet great since the energy's that really cause madness are only learned later along the path of magic they choose.

While they are still magicians a crazed mind makes them unpredictable and they often attack in unsuspecting ways and have little or no regard for their own safety.
If one finds themselves before one such enemy they should be cautious and if possible not fight. However if it comes to a fight striking fast and striking first is the key to victory.
