Banes are humanoid creatures with incredible strength, cunning and agility. They are not undead but rather something else entirely. Not much is known about them other than they are extremely dangerous and hostile.
They have the basic body of a man and would seem almost human except for the fact that they have an non-human demonic face. Usually viscous red eyes and red skin around their face with rows of sharpened teeth, their hands clawed instead of having fingers.

Most banes exert power with inhuman speed, strength and other physical abilities. They can scream at a pitch that stuns and disorientates their prey and strike fear into most creatures, animals and humans alike.
All banes specialize in physical combat using weapons such as swords, axes amongst a few others. However, although it is exceedingly rare some Banes can use magic. These are the deadliest and most unpredictable and make for fierce opponents.

All Banes are incredibly intelligent with profound understanding of tactics, combat, languages and their prey. All banes, although some are unable to use magic, are still able to resurrect dead bodies and turn them into wights.
Although not much is know about that process. Most people don't get that close and live. Finally Banes have a language which they all speak fluently although little is known of its origin and not one human has a full understanding of the evil tongue.

Overall they are some of the most deadliest, evil monsters roaming the lands of progma and should be approached with extreme caution if not at all.
