In many areas of Progma there roam living skeletons, wandering aimlessly looking for any victims foolish enough to cross their paths.
These being are usually equipped with items such as swords, shields, bows and arrows but are also known to have some with the ability to use magic.

While not the most dangerous foes, many an adventurer has lost their lives underestimating these abominations. They are fast, strong and incredibly cunning.
Usually they are found in small groups numbering about four or five with a mixture of different types such as some archers, some warriors and if your unlucky, a magician.

However, they are also known to roam alone and there have been rumours of them organising into groups as large as ten or twenty and organising to attack towns and villages.
Whenever they are seen in groups this large there is usually one or two skeletal magicians behind the scenes co-ordinating things.
While they are a tough bunch any sharp blade or powerful spell aught to be enough to make short work of them.

Just remember they are much more than they seem and should be approached with a relative amount of caution.
