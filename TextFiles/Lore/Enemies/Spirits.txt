These ethereal beings are very rarely seen and keep mostly to themselves. If you leave them alone they generally wont bother you. Very little is know of what they are or how they came to be.
However if one is foolish enough to attack them they will pay for it with blood. These things are resistant to physical weapons and many magics, while being extremely knowledgeable in the arts of magic themselves.

The strength of their spells far exceeds that which a human magician could ever hope to achieve. They can cast spells unknown to mortal magician and use a area of magic that other cannot understand or comprehend.
This is one of the areas of magic that isn't classed as a main type. Of what type it is nobody knows or if they do they have kept it to themselves. All in all these being are extremely powerful and dangerous if provoked.
If you find yourself face to face with one just back up slowly and definitely don't provoke it!
