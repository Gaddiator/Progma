A werewolf is a beast like creature that usually lives in forested areas. In the lands of progma meeting one is extremely unlikely.
However if you do happen to see one a smart move would be to run away as fast as you can. They are very strong and agile with cunning to match that of a scholar.

Usually a fully grown male or female werewolf stand about seven and a half feet tall. Although some males can grow up to nine feet tall.
While males are much bigger, faster and stronger they are less aggressive than their female counterparts. Also not as smart.

Usually they prefer the taste of animal flesh but are known to eat more than one man unlucky enough to cross their path.
They are great climbers and can run extremely fast. Their claws make for deadly weapons, but its their teeth and jaws that are deadliest.
Each tooth inches long and sharp as daggers with two huge protruding canines that allow them to crush bones and tear limbs from victims.

Overall they are a extremely deadly enemy and very versatile and should be approached with great caution if not at all
