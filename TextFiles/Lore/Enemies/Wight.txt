A wight is a humanoid monsters resurrected by powerful beings know as Banes to serve as there defenders and loyal servants. While they do not look like much all wights are infused with magic when resurrected.
This gives them certain physical abilities such as enhanced speed and strength. They also have a high resistance to cold, some types of magic and physical weapons.

They are found in many places across the lands of Progma and are usually accompanied by at least one Bane who would be their master. They are know to be extremely aggressive and hostile toward all living beings.
While not very bright they still retain a portion of their intelligence. They can determine how dangerous a foe might be.
They can formulate simple plans suck as flanking maneuvers and when to attack and when to fall back.

Wights are unable to use any form of magic, their rotten brains unable to formulate the necessary thoughts.
