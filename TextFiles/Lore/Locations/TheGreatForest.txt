This forest spans much of Progma's southern lands and is mainly uninhabited although if legends are correct there are some who brave its depths and live beneath the gnarled branches.
The true size of this forest is immense and if one were to venture even a little bit too deep they could be lost forever.

Lots of superstition and fears revolve around this place and the people that live close to it have very strange tales indeed.
Many creatures reside within such as deer, foxes, rabbits, wolves, bears, birds and many more.

According to recent stories there have been sightings of a werewolf within, but these are most likely just fanciful tales to keep children from delving within its twilight depths.
Even the most skilled woodsmen are generally reluctant to delve inside the forest for fear of not returning.
Mostly everyone who has entered in the past has returned insane and gibbering nonsense or not at all. This has caused people to fear the forest and to avoid it at all costs.

If you are foolish enough to enter, come well prepared or don't come at all.
