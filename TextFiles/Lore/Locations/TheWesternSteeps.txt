These snowy mountains tower over much of Progma's western lands and are mostly uninhabited except for the odd traveler or merchant.
However, if rumours are to be believed the Andvarii have many of their secret Temples hidden within these icy peaks acting as a refuge for all the mages off Progma.

If you have any plans to explore the land of ice come well prepared. Items such as thick boots and robes, weaponry, armour, food and some other supplies.
It is an extremely cold and perilous place with dangers such as snowstorms, avalanches, frostbite and even bears and wolfs amongst other things.
Recently there have been rumours of wights patrolling the area, and even some stories of a bane.

More than likely these are just wild tales being created by the Andvarii to keep anyone who would wish them harm out of their mountains.
However one cannot be certain until one is certain, and to recklessly believe that tales are only tales could be very foolish indeed.
Are you certain or are you foolish?
