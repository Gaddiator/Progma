Magic is very powerful and because of this it has become a thing to be fearful off. The Houses of Wyrddin and Vikir despise magic and its users believing it to be an unnatural thing.
Both are very secretly hunting and killing off all of the magicians that they cannot control in Progma. If the people of Progma knew what they were doing it would spark a war.
Many magicians are retreating to their hidden temples to avoid being murdered by the people who fear them.

Most of the population of Progma believe that magic is a necessary thing. They remember proud, intelligent and honest magicians. Good magicians.
They know nothing of the evil and vile magicians. The ones who kill and lie, pilfer and steal and abuse their powers.

One thing is for sure magic users in Progma face a deadly fight for survival.
