Magicians are gifted humans with the ability to use and manipulate forces to do their bidding. The ability to do this is very rare and rarer still to realize that one possesses the ability.
Due to this there aren't many magicians roaming the lands of progma and out of the ones that are many haven't received a proper apprenticeship let alone mastered their powers.

A group of mages know as the "Andvarii" search for fellow magicians and try to teach them the finer control of their powers. They have multiple temples in and outside progma for exactly this purpose.
These temples act as a haven for fellow magicians, places to rest and recuperate, to study and learn and to be selected to study in one is considered a great honor.

There are twelve known temples in progma, each in different locations, and usually secluded from the rest of society. Some locations are hidden to all but magicians whilst other locations are common knowledge.
Overall magicians are people with powerful arcane abilities that give them the ability to manipulate the elements, certain energy's and many creatures amongst other things.
