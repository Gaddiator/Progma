Firstly create a body weight system in kilo grams for the player to enter at character creation/selection. 
Next, using a reputation system slightly nudge the npc's liking of a player up or down depending on their body weight.

For example if the player was of a higher body weight e.g 90kg he would be easier to interact with mercants and nobility, traders, common people, etc.

For this to work properly another factor would need to be implemented. 
This factor would need to calculate the players state of overall fitness based on things such as body composition, diet, physical exercise etc.
For example, fit, healthy, average, poor, soft, etc.
