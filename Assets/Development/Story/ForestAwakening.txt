The sound of running water brings you to your senses. Opening your eyes you take a long look around. From what you can see you seem to be in a forest, and a very large one at that.
Great trees loom overhead, far out of sight. To your left is a stream which continues into the brush. Wild bushes spouting succulent red berries are dotted around.
A few large moss covered stones lay in a small clearing ahead of you. Apart from that you see only a few other plants, some flowers, and the nearly knee high grass covering everything.
You don't remember how you got here. Your stomach grumbles and your parched throat is as dry as the great plains of Ascardia.
