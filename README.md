# Progma

Hello my name is _Caol√°n Gadd_ and welcome to the lands of **Progma**.

**Progma** is a extremely detailed _text-based_, _multiple choice_, _open world_, _dark fantasy_, _role playing game_ all perceived through what I alone have created through use of my unfathomable linguistic skills.

You will choose to play as either, the intelligent _magician_, the powerful _warrior_ or the cunning _rogue_. The choices you make when deciding the class you want to play as will _**drastically**_ change your entire experience and play-style.
These three classes have different _advantages_, _disadvantages_, _skills_ and _abilities_ with many different paths and specialities to branch off into.

Once complete you will be thrust into the fictional lands of **Progma**.
In this world you will meet many unique _enemies_, _characters_, _organisations_. Find powerful _weapons_, _armour_ and  _equipment_.
Explore fascinating _areas_ and _environments_ all the whilst forging the character and unique play-style to suit you.

Among these areas are the chilly western steeps, the mysterious great forest, a handful of busy towns, some isolated villages, a few crumbling castles, 
a collection of dark and dingy caves, a couple of dangerous dungeons, some lakes and many more unique and intriguing locations.

In the world of **Progma** there are _social constructs_, _religious and military constructs_, _provinces_, _wars_, _hostilities_, _factions_ and **_so much more_**.
You will be thrust into the center of it all learning the way of the world and how to interact with the people within it.

You will have to ensure your character _eats_, _sleeps_, and _rests_. You will have to keep them _warm_ and _protected_. You will face challenges and fight to overcome them.
There will be times where you will prevail, other times you will not. There will be times where you will need to run and hide, and times where you will need to stand and fight.
There will be times for caution and _stealth_. Then there will be times for ferocity, blood and battle and finally if your not careful there will be time for naught but death!

As you explore your _stats_ will increase and you will learn new _skills_ as your character gets more and more powerful.
You will spend time growing your _magical_ prowess, _combat_ effectiveness and upgrading your arsenal of supplies and items.

In places the land is harsh, conditions unforgiving and for those foolish enough to come unprepared, **_only death awaits_**!
The journey you will take in this world will not be easy, it will not be hard, it will be a constant tough, grimy fight to survive.

_Good luck._
